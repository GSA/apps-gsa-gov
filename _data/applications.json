Any change to a system requires an SCR. After submittal, the standard SCR workflow enforced by SBM includes: conceptual approval, estimation for the number of hours, funding approval, assignment to an upcoming release and build, requirements analysis, design, development, unit test, peer review, independent system test, and deployment. Of course, there are fast-track steps available within SBM for critical SCRs. A build is an iteration of development and testing, and it contains one or more SCRs. All SCRs in a build must be ready for test before the build is assembled and deployed to the testing environment. A release represents any scheduled or unscheduled change to system(s) in production. A release contains one or more builds, which each contain one or more SCRs. All SCRs in a release must have passed testing before the release is presented to the government approval authority for the go/no-go decision to put the release into production. In order to get the release ready, either the release must wait for any remaining SCRs that have not passed testing, or these SCRs can be deferred to a later release. A BCR is a mechanism to group together SCRs with related functionality that will be satisfied by changes to multiple applications or fulfilled in multiple pieces as part of more than one release. Tasks are created for analysis, development, deployment, or support. A task can be tied to an SCR/BCR or created independently. There is a web services integration with real-time updates between SBM and HP Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) so that test defects can be identified in ALM, assigned to a build and fixed in SBM, re-tested in ALM, and deployed using SBM.","SSO":"FAS - Federal Acquisition Service (Q)","SSOShort":"FAS (Q)","Owner":"GSA IT - Office of Acquisition IT Services (IQ)","OwnerShort":"Acquisition IT (IQ)","System":null,"BusinessPOC":"Pebble Randolph,Kevin Payne,Claudia Brumbach,Randy Matlack,George Adam,Satyaveer Satvat,Peter Bastone","TechnicalPOC":"Kevin Payne","Cloud":"No","TechnologyPlatform":"Provided as Package","Status":"Production","Alias":null,"RegionClassification":"National","HostingProvider":"GSA","FISMASystem":null,"Investment":"Federal Acquisition Service Corporate","IsRevenueGenerator":"No","DesktopComponent":"TBD","RetiredYear":null,"Capabilities":"Platform Management,Applications Life Cycle Management Support,Platform Management and Application Framework,IT System Development / Integration Support,Support Delivery of Federal Services,General Government,Manage GSA","Technologies":"Serena Software SBM 10,Microsoft IIS 7,\"Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5\",Microsoft SQL Server 2008","Link":"https://sbm01.gsa.gov/tmtrack/tmtrack.dll?"},{"Id":5949,"Name":"Schedule 70","Description":"The Schedule 70 Review Processes is a FAS Salesforce application located in the Workflow App. The purpose of this application is to capture and allow for the process flow and recommendation for the legal, financial and Small Business Subcontracting Reviews related to a Schedule 70 proposal or existing contract.","SSO":"FAS - Federal Acquisition Service (Q)","SSOShort":"FAS (Q)","Owner":"FAS - Office of Information Technology Category (QT)","OwnerShort":"ITC (QT)","System":null,"BusinessPOC":"Benjamin Taylor,Satyaveer Satvat","TechnicalPOC":"Robert Donovan","Cloud":"No","TechnologyPlatform":"- Not Provided","Status":"Retired","Alias":null,"RegionClassification":"National","HostingProvider":"GSA","FISMASystem":null,"Investment":null,"IsRevenueGenerator":"- TBD","DesktopComponent":"TBD","RetiredYear":"2015","Capabilities":"Source Selection,Award,Contract Administration and Performance Monitoring","Technologies":null,"Link":null},{"Id":5960,"Name":"SIP - Schedule Input Program Tool","Description":"As part of its responsibilities, the VSC maintains and operates the Schedule Input Program (SIP) Tool.

OHRM workload Tracker is used to track when milestones occur (e.g., date to fill vacancy, date to issue certificate) and when recruitments move to the next phase.  The tracker auto-calculates the time elapsed between milestones, and provides reports to help management understand whether the organization is meeting its internal SLAs and OPM 80 day hiring standard.  User reports also help hiring specialists manage their workload efficiently; for example there are aging reports that help highlight areas that need action (e.g., a week has elapsed, and the HR specialist need to contact the hiring manager).","SSO":"OHRM - Office of Human Resources Management (C)","SSOShort":"OHRM (C)","Owner":"OHRM - Office of HR Services (CP)","OwnerShort":"HR Services (CP)","System":null,"BusinessPOC":"Silvia Barnes,Paul Tsagaroulis","TechnicalPOC":"Alfred Ortega","Cloud":"No","TechnologyPlatform":".Net","Status":"Production","Alias":"SharePoint Workload Tracker","RegionClassification":"National","HostingProvider":"GSA","FISMASystem":null,"Investment":"GSA IT Document Management","IsRevenueGenerator":"No","DesktopComponent":"No","RetiredYear":null,"Capabilities":"Manage GSA,General Government,Support Delivery of Federal Services,Document Management and workflow,Central personnel management,Staffing and Recruiting","Technologies":"Microsoft SharePoint Designer 2010,Microsoft IIS 8,\"Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5\",\"Microsoft C# 4.0\",JavaScript,Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard","Link":null},{"Id":35455,"Name":"Telework Agreement Tool","Description":"Online Telework Agreement allows employees to submit the telework agreements that reflect the agreement between the employee and the current supervisor.

Additionally, 19 premier courthouses are publicly accessible on gsa.gov.The current set of case studies will inform GSA's execution of $800M of work for 8 new-construction courthouse projects plus $160M in courthouse repair and alteration projects that Congress funded in FY16, and which are actively kicking off in FY17. Without access to Courtsweb, GSA would be challenged to provide high-quality design based on the best available knowledge.
