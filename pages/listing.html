      <h4 id="sewp">NASA SEWP</h4>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.sewp.nasa.gov/" target="blank">NASA Solutions for Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP)</a> is a multi-award GWAC vehicle focused on commercial IT products and product based services. There are 147 pre-competed Contract Holders that serve as vendors of IT technologies.</p>
      <p>To be procured using the SEWP contract vehicle, a government contracting officer will submit a Request for Quote (RFQ) to the SEWP team, which is then sent out to the 147 vendors. They will identify the appropriate technology, negotiate terms, and compete the prices, which will then be returned to the government contracting officer for selection. The turn around for this process is estimated to take 4-7 business days.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to preemptively list your product with SEWP vendors to expedite the RFQ process, please reach out to <a href="mailto:help@sewp.nasa.gov">help@nasa.gov</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="reviews">Reviews</h2>
      <h4 id="tos">Federally-compatible ToS</h4>
      <p>When selling to the federal government, companies will often be required to negotiate a federal-compatible Terms of Service. A list of approved negotiated ToS can be found at <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/negotiated-terms-of-service-agreements/" target="blank">digitalgov.gov</a>, which may not be fully encompassing. Additionally, because negotiated TOS are often determined at the agency level (requiring agency legal review), there are POCs for each agency, identified <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/agency-points-of-contact-for-federal-compatible-terms-of-service-agreements/" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
      <h4 id="pta">Privacy Threshold Analysis</h4>
      <p>A Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) document is a form used for all information technology systems that are going through the certification and accreditation (C&amp;A) process required under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), to determine whether they properly maintain personally identifiable information (PII). The PTA includes a description of the system, what PII, if any, is collected or used, and from whom.</p>
      <h4 id="pia">Privacy Impact Assessment</h4>
      <p>When personal information on individuals is collected and used as a part of a system, the product team is required to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment (reference: <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda_m03-22" target="blank">E-Government Act of 2002</a>). A PIA or Adapted PIA may need to be written for any IT system that collects, stores, and makes retrievable people’s personally identifiable information. Further work and approval from the agency’s Chief Privacy Officer may be required. The PIA explains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The information collected is used only for the intended purpose;</li>
        <li>The information is timely and accurate;</li>
        <li>The information is protected according to applicable laws and regulations while in GSA’s possession;</li>
        <li>The impact of the information systems on individual privacy is fully addressed; and</li>
        <li>The public is aware of the information GSA collects and how the information is used.</li>
        <li>Further work and approval from the agency’s Chief Privacy Officer may be required.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="sorn">Systems of Record Notice (SORN)</h4>
      <p>Regulates the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information (PII) about people (referred to as a “system of records”) by the government. A SORN may be required when collecting, storing, and making retrievable people’s personally identifiable information. More information regarding SORNs can be found <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104265" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A System of Record is created when a group of information is collected and stored in a way that can be retrieved by the name of an individual, or by any number, symbol, or other unique identifier assigned to that individual.</li>
        <li>The Privacy Act requires that any system of record be publicized via a SORN, which is a notice published to the Federal Register for public comment. This process lasts a minimum of 60 days.</li>
        <li>Further work and approval from the agency’s Chief Privacy Officer may be required.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="ato-overview">Authority to Operate</h4>
      <p>Governed by the <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/drivers/documents/FISMA-final.pdf" target="blank">Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002</a>, or FISMA, each agency will require an Authority to Operate (ATO) before an IT system is approved to be used within an organization or agency. The ATO represents the agency conducting an appropriate security review of the IT system. There are various types of ATOs, which have different requirements, noted below.</p>
      <p id="ato-agency"><strong>Agency ATO</strong></p>
      <p>Agency ATOs are issued and approved at the agency head or delegated authority level. The process in which agencies follow to appropriately assess an IT system may vary based on the controls and mechanisms for each agency.</p>
      <p id="fedramp"><strong>FedRAMP</strong></p>
      <p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov" target="blank">FedRAMP</a>, is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. This approach uses a “do once, use many times” framework that saves an estimated 30-40% of government costs, as well as both time and staff required to conduct redundant agency security assessments. FedRAMP is the result of close collaboration with cybersecurity and cloud experts from the General Services Administration (GSA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DOD), National Security Agency (NSA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council and its working groups, as well as private industry.</p>
      <p>The cloud systems can take one of three paths to become FedRAMP compliant: JAB Provisional Authorization (P-ATO), Agency Authorization, and Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Supplied Package. No matter which path a CSP has taken — JAB, Agency, or CSP Supplied — all cloud systems listed here have demonstrate FedRAMP compliance and can be leveraged by any agency. Additional details for each path is listed below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li id="fedramp-jab"><strong>JAB Provisional Authorizations:</strong> Cloud systems listed under the FedRAMP P-ATO path have undergone a rigorous technical review by the FedRAMP PMO, been assessed by a FedRAMP accredited 3PAO, and received a P-ATO from the DHS, DOD, and GSA CIOs.</li>
        <li id="fedramp-agency"><strong>Agency FedRAMP Authorizations:</strong> Cloud systems listed under the Agency Authorization have worked directly with a customer agency to achieve a FedRAMP compliant ATO that has been verified by the FedRAMP PMO.<br/><br/>FedRAMP Compliant (In PMO Review) is a designation for Agency ATO Authorization Packages only. This designation signifies that the CSP’s cloud system has been granted an ATO by an agency and has submitted all required documentation for review to the FedRAMP PMO. Once the FedRAMP PMO completes an Initial Review of the package the CSP will be listed as FedRAMP Compliant.</li>
        <li id="fedramp-csp"><strong>CSP Supplied Packages:</strong> Cloud systems listed under the CSP Supplied Package path have submitted to the FedRAMP PMO a completed Security Assessment Package (SAP) that has been assessed by a FedRAMP accredited 3PAO.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="add-testing">Additional Testing</h4>
      <p>To assist government buyers in making informed descisions when procuring cloud products, below is a list of some additional tests.</p>
      <p id="fedramp-ready"><strong>FedRAMP Ready</strong></p>
      <p>FedRAMP Ready is a milestone step that ensures that a CSP’s documentation meets the FedRAMP PMO’s minimum quality and security standards. CSPs must pass an Initial Review of their SSP before being listed as FedRAMP Ready on fedramp.gov. The SSP includes twelve attachments that must also be evaluated during the Initial Review:
        <ul>
          <li>FIPS Pub 199</li>
          <li>E-Authentication Template</li>
          <li>Information System Security Policies and Procedures</li>
          <li>Configuration Management (CM) Plan</li>
          <li>Control Implementation Summary (CIS)</li>
          <li>CIS Worksheet</li>
          <li>IT Contingency Plan (CP)</li>
          <li>Incident Response Plan (IRP)</li>
          <li>Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) / Privacy Impact Analysis (PIA)</li>
          <li>User Guide</li>
          <li>Rules of Behavior (ROB)</li>
          <li>Signature Page</li>
        </ul>
      A CSP can be listed as FedRAMP Ready on fedramp.gov for maximum of one year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/marketplace/fedramp-ready-systems/" target="blank">FedRAMP Ready</a> CSPs  have proven they are ready for agency or FedRAMP PMO detailed reviews required to become FedRAMP Compliant and gives agencies the confidence that the SSP documentation meets the FedRAMP PMO’s quality and security standards that are necessary to initiate the assessment and authorization process with the JAB.</p>
      <p id="fedramp-infra"><strong>FedRAMP Infrastructure</strong></p>
      <p>This designation is for CSPs who are currently hosted on FedRAMP approved infrastructure. This does not represent FedRAMP approval, only a designation to help further inform a government buyer.</p>

      <p id="hipaa"><strong>HIPAA</strong></p>
      <p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA; Pub.L. 104–191, 110 Stat. 1936, enacted August 21, 1996) was enacted by the United States Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996. It has been known as the Kennedy–Kassebaum Act or Kassebaum–Kennedy Act after two of its leading sponsors.[1][2] Title I of HIPAA protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs. Title II of HIPAA, known as the Administrative Simplification (AS) provisions, requires the establishment of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act" target="blank">Wikipedia</a>).

      <p id="pci"><strong>PCI</strong></p>
      <p>The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle branded credit cards from the major card schemes including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB. Private label cards – those which aren't part of a major card scheme – are not included in the scope of the PCI DSS.</p>
      <p>The PCI Standard is mandated by the card brands and administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. The standard was created to increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card fraud. Validation of compliance is performed annually, either by an external Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) that creates a Report on Compliance (ROC) for organizations handling large volumes of transactions, or by Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) for companies handling smaller volumes (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard" target="blank">Wikipedia</a>).
